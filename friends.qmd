## Loading and Preparing the Data

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python}

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Clean up if needed
df["U.S. viewers"] = df["U.S. viewers"].astype(str).str.extract(r"([\d.]+)").astype(float)
df["U.S. viewers"] = pd.to_numeric(df["U.S. viewers"], errors="coerce")

df.head()
```

## Basic Statistics

```{python}
print("Total number of episodes:", len(df))
print("Average viewership (millions):", round(df["U.S. viewers"].mean(), 2))
print("Max viewership (millions):", df["U.S. viewers"].max())
print("Min viewership (millions):", df["U.S. viewers"].min())
```

## Viewership Over Time

```{python}

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
plt.plot(df["No. overall"], df["U.S. viewers"], marker='o', linestyle='-')
plt.title("Friends: Episode Viewership Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Episode Number")
plt.ylabel("Viewership (millions)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Average Viewership by Season

```{python}
# The viewership drop between season 3 and 5
avg_s3 = df[df["season"] == 3]["U.S. viewers"].mean()
avg_s5 = df[df["season"] == 5]["U.S. viewers"].mean()

viewership_drop = round(avg_s3 - avg_s5, 2)

avg_s3, avg_s5, viewership_drop
```

```{python}
# Group by season and find the average
season_avg = df.groupby("season")["U.S. viewers"].mean()

# Find the season with the lowest average rating
lowest_season = season_avg.idxmin()
lowest_avg = round(season_avg.min(), 2)

lowest_season, lowest_avg
```

```{python}
season_avg = df.groupby("season")["U.S. viewers"].mean()

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
season_avg.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title("Average Viewership per Season")
plt.xlabel("Season")
plt.ylabel("Average Viewers (millions)")
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.grid(axis='y')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
